## Configuration

Database Finder requires configuration, such as the Hippo CMS to communicate
with. To set the configuration, create a "config/searchers/" directory in your
application (the "searchers" subdirectory may need to be created), and copy the
"config/database_finder_config.yml" file in this gem into it. Follow the
instructions in the file to configure the searcher.

Additional customizations can be done by editing the "config/locales/en.yml" file.

## Additional Result Information

This searcher returns the following additional information about each item:

* "restricted" - true if the item has restricted remote access, false otherwise.
* "info_link" - a URL to the entry in Database Finder
* "item_format" - Always returns "database"
